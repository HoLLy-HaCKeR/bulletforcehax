# BulletForceHax
Aka "Bánh mì - Bullet Force"

This is going to be a rewrite in Rust. Old Dart code can be found in the old_master, old_angular and old_cli-bot branches.

## Dependencies
TODO, but you're gonna need rust and wasm-pack (and python3 for dev)

## Setting up dev environment
- compile rust project with `wasm-pack build --target=web --dev` in the `bulletforcehax` directory
- run `run_local_server.py` in the `tools` directory

TODO: setup for local game files
